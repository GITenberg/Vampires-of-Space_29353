description: Based on its title, this tale might sound like an absurd bit of space-opera
  fluff, but it's actually a deeply engaging story packed with interesting theories
  and ideas. The "vampires" in question aren't literal bloodsuckers, but rather are
  mysterious beings who subsist on the life force of others. It's a fascinating and
  thought-provoking tale that will please connoisseurs of classic science fiction.
